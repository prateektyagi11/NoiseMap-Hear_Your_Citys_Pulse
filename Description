Noisemap is a data-driven system designed to monitor and visualize environmental noise levels across geographic locations. The platform collects noise intensity data from IoT/microphone nodes, processes the readings in real time, and displays them as color-coded hotspots on an interactive map. Users can analyze spatial noise distribution, detect abnormal noise spikes, and study noise patterns across time.

⭐ Key Features
